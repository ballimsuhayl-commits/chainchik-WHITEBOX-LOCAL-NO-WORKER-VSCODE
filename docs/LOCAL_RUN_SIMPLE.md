# Local Run (Simplest)

Use this if you want the easiest possible local test, with the least moving parts.

## Requirements
- Docker Desktop installed and running

## Start
Double-click: **START-SIMPLE.bat**

Open:
- Store: http://127.0.0.1:3000
- Admin: http://127.0.0.1:3000/admin
- API: http://127.0.0.1:4000

## Stop
Double-click: **STOP-SIMPLE.bat**

## What is different from full mode?
- No MinIO (simplest local)
- No Caddy/HTTPS (local only)
- Still full order/admin flow for testing
