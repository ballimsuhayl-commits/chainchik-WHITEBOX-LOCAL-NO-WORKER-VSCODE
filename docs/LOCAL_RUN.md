# Run locally (easiest)

## Windows (recommended)
1. Install **Docker Desktop** and open it (must be running).
2. Open the project folder.
3. Double-click: **START-LOCAL.bat**

Open:
- Store: http://127.0.0.1
- Admin: http://127.0.0.1/admin

Stop:
- Double-click: **STOP-LOCAL.bat**

## Notes
- This runs everything with Docker.
- If your machine can't expose port 3000, this uses port 80 instead.
